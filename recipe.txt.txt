Choclate cake (base):
Preheat oven to 350Â°. 
Line three 9-in. round baking pans with waxed paper; grease and flour the pans and paper. Set aside.
In a large bowl, beat cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes.
Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
Beat in vanilla. 
Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt and baking powder; add to the creamed mixture alternately with milk, beating well after each addition.
Transfer to prepared pans. 
Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20-25 minutes. 
Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.

Prepping the ice cream:
Line a suitably round bowl with cling wrap (this will be the shape of the top of the cake)
Empty ice cream into the bowl  
place in freezer for at least an hour







Meringue:
Add a pinch of cream of tartar to the egg whites
Beat the egg white mixture in a large bowl with an electric mixer until foamy. 
Gradually add the sugar, making sure to consistently beat the mixture until it forms stiff peaks.
(note: stiff peaks means that the mixture is no longer runny, and sticks to the whisk like a "stiff peak.")


Assembly:
Have chocolate cake base ready
pull the cling wrap with ice cream out of the bowl and carefully place the molded ice cream on the cake base.
Once the ice cream is secure, peel off the cling wrap.
Lastly, ice the cake with the meringue either rubbing it on with a spatula or piping it on with a piping bag.

Optional: use a blowtorch or lighter to roast the meringue and make it a "Baked Alaska").
